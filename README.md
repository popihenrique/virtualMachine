In reviewing the provided CSV file, can you identify and suggest any modifications
that might enhance the web page's performance or optimize memory usage?
What about for large number of rows? Please provide a thorough justification for
each recommendation.

With the current requirements i only need to search trought the document and find 3 itens, the one that user is searching for, the most expensive and the least expensive,
as this is i see no improvemants that can be made, only if i rendered many itens, like a list of all VMs, in that case some changes would be needed, would use something
like list virtualization where i render only the visible slice of the list (as it has thousens of itens)
